# Pico Vector

VectorNest is a privacy-first local vector database. Essentially, it serves as a long-term memory for LLMs. VectorNest is designed to be LLM-agnostic. This means that it can work seamlessly with any existing and future LLM. The major benefit of this approach is that VectorNest will be able to grow alongside future AI developments, always staying relevant and efficient.

Unique to VectorNest is that it is 100% Swift and utilizes Apple Silicon hardware acceleration. This ensures that VectorNest not only performs optimally but also integrates smoothly with Apple's ecosystem.
